<h4 style="color: powderblue; font-size:200% ">Mac DeMarco thrills Seattle Audience</h4>   
<p>The night ended with the psychedelic, dreamy track “Chamber of Reflection.” Typically during his closing song, DeMarco <br> 
jumps into the crowd or does something just as wild, but doubts were rising because the show was seated rather than <br> 
general admission. But what would a Mac Demarco concert be without a little crowd surfing? He managed to pull the <br> 
crowd out of their seats and cluster them together, and was then able to continue the tradition of the crowdsurf.</p>

 <h4 style="color:pink; font-size:200%">What is Alice in Chains about?&#128151;</h4>
        <p> Alice in Chains is a grunge band that started in <span style="border: 1px solid white">SEATTLE WASHINGTON</span> . My brother describes their music as <br> sad, sickly, and whiney with the essense of a struggling, dying dog that's been mistreated their entire life.<br> The band was known for their abuse of heroin and it showed in their music how much in pain they were. Their <br> fans related to that and they gained popularity very quickly. Their songs were about how they were never going to make it out <br> of their addiction alive and their hopelessness in life.  Jerry Cantrell, Alice in Chains were known on <br> occasion to mix up country and grunge together. This odd mixture of genres deemed to be unique and successful.</p>

<h4 style="color:crimson; font-size:200%">Lane Stanely and Jerry Cantrell</h4>
<p> Lane Staley used to be the lead singer and co-songwriter, but sadly he passed away in 2002. His voice was<br> comparable to none and had such a unique amazing range. Lane's father wasn't in the picture when he was a child.<br> Growing up he was addicted to heroin. Jerry Cantrell was also a heroin addict and they used each other<br> to fuel their addiciton together. Later in life when Lane Stanely's career was starting to begin and he was<br> gaining fame, his girlfriend commited suicide by drug overdose. Not long after, Lane Stanely overdosed in Los<br> Angeles and died. Jerry Cantrell was the founder, lead guitarist, and main songwriter for Alice in Chains. He<br> was the other piece that kept the band together and what made it what it was.</p>
